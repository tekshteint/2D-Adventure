# 2D-Scroller

A 2D scrolling game made entirely from standard Java libraries. Currently a WIP but all of the base functionality is there. This is a side project of mine that I have been working on whenever I have downtime from schoolwork. My first real game as I don't count the tic tac toe I made as that was to mainly teach myself JFrame and JPanel characteristics.

Working currently on implementing NPCs, Monsters, Items, Inventory, and gameplay mechanics.
