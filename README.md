# 2D-Scroller

A 2D scrolling game made entirely from standard Java libraries. Currently a WIP but all of the base functionality is there. This is a side project of mine that I have been working on whenever I have downtime from schoolwork. 
This is my first real game as I don't count the tic tac toe I made as that was to mainly teach myself JFrame and JPanel characteristics.

The current gameplay consists of navigating through the world using the WASD keys to find a key and opening a door to explore the 2D pixel art world. There is also a powerup token which will increase the player speed for a short period. The world is rendered using chunks similar to MineCraft, and implements a scrolling camera worldview to help with efficient gameplay with minimal lag.


Working currently on implementing NPCs, Monsters, Items, Inventory, and gameplay mechanics.
